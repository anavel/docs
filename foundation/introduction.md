#### Modular CMS for Laravel 5+ applications

Before starting a new project, there is a difficult decision on whether it will be based on a framework or on a CMS. When choosing to use a framework, you need to spend much time creating CMS features for the project. On the other hand, when choosing to use a CMS, it's more difficult to build custom application functionality. It is impossible or at least very hard to customize the core parts of the CMS.
Anavel is created to solve this framework versus CMS dilemma. It provides **modules** with which you can **easily add CMS features** to your project. But you **still have flexibility** and in all cases you are using the Laravel, so you can build custom functionality the way you want.

With Anavel you can build a full-featured admin panel for your Laravel based application in minutes without changing your project's source code.
